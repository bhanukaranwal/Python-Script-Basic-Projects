Concept:
Players build a “word snake” by selecting words from a list so that each new word starts with the last letter of the previous word. The goal is to keep the snake going as long as possible without repeating words or making an invalid link!
Features:

Encourages vocabulary, planning, and logic.

Tracks a growing “snake” of unique words.

Ends the game when no valid next word is available or if the player quits.

Easy to expand with a larger word list or even user-entered words for an extra challenge!
